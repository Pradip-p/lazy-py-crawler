there's no place like home
there's no point crying over spilt milk
there we go
there is nothing more courageous than someone in search of your dreams.
there's no use crying over spilt milk
there's no use
there's only one
there's nowt so queer as folk
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there ought to be a law
there oughtta be a law
these things happen
there you go
there was a time
there's always a bigger fish
there's no fool like an old fool
there she blows
there may be snow on the rooftop but there is fire in the furnace
there's a sucker born every minute
there's more where that came from
there oughta be a law
there's no accounting for tastes

there, there
there's been an accident
there's no there there
there is reason in the roasting of eggs
there's nothing to it
there you have it
there's no such thing as a stupid question
there's many a slip twixt cup and lip
there ya go
there is nothing new under the sun
there's a grain of truth in every joke
therein lies the rub
there's life in the old dog yet
there you go!
there isn't any easy way to say this

the whistle does not pull the train
then and there
the writing is on the wall
there is a new sheriff in town
there for everyone to see
there is an exception to every rule
there is no point in forgiving anyone who does not feel guilty.
the thing is
the thing of it
the wealthiest man has the biggest hump.
the world is one's lobster
the world over
there are two sides to every question
there are none so blind as those who will not see
there but for the grace of god go i
there is a dream in the nightmare.
the wheels fell off the wagon
there and back

the screwing you get isn't worth the screwing you take
the plot thickens
the screwing you get isn't worth the screwing you're going to get
the sky is the limit
the story goes
the streets are paved with gold
the show
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the prince
the shoe is on the other foot
the shoemaker's children go barefoot
the rest is history
the silence of a lion is not that he is a fool but for determination and accuracy.
the sky is the moon
the penny drops
the smartest, clearer person probably has no friends
the natives are getting restless
the salt of the earth
the pen is mightier than the sword
the terrorists will have won
the pants off
the natives are restless
the pinnacle of love, is seen in the mother's actions which are rarely self-realized.
the nut does not fall far from the tree!
the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
the screwing you get isn't worth the screwing you get
the name of the game
the rabbit died
the pits
the straw that broke the camel's back
the party is over
the more things change, the more they stay the same
the rubber meets the road
the old woman is plucking her goose
the one who always envies someone in society, will never live in gaiety
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
the rubber hits the road
the stroke of noon/midnight
the place to be
the proof is in the pudding
the pick of the litter
the show must go on
the night is young
the other day
the plural of anecdote is not data

the law is a ass
the map is not the territory
the hell out of
the joke's on someone
the good doctors
the lights are on, but nobody's home
the lady doth protest too much, methinks
the law is an ass
The Hell You Say?
the icing on the cake
the long arm of the law
the good doctor
the length of the Flemington straight
the more the merrier
the grapes are sour anyway
the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing
the long and short of it
the luck of the draw
the lady doth protest too much
the gutter press
the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
the good die young
the line is busy
the long and short
the man
the handbags come out
the jetset way
the grass is always greener on the other side
The Lord works in mysterious ways
the ivy can grow no higher than its host
the jury is still out
the girl said my condition is anatoria
the marriage sank into prosiness
the joke is on someone
the lady with rocky determination and her own choices best suited to human beings
the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world
that's it
that's the way life is
thats whats up
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
the box they're going to bury it in
the British are coming
that's life
the bears get rich, the bulls get rich & the hogs go broke!
That's the Way the Ball Bounces
the apple does not fall far from the tree
that's just me
Thatcher's children
that's what she said
the ayes have it
that's the way the ball bounces
that's what's up
the bee's knees
the beast with two backs
the bill, please
the biter bit
that's the spirit
that's that
that's saying something
the big kahuna
that's what I'm talking about
that's the ticket
the boot is on the other foot
the art of being naïve is being questioned by the art of being "right" all the time.
the bad penny always turns up

that's my
the buck stops here
that's the way the mop flops
the bad penny always comes back
that's the way the cookie crumbles!

the bigger they are, the harder they fall
the ball is in someone's court

the devil is a liar
the flying dutchman
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
the damage is done
the fucking you get isn't worth the fucking you're going to get
the doctor always err's on the side of caution.
the end justifies the means
the engineer of the train can hostle his own locomotive.
the end of one's rope
the fix is in
the doc says im going blind but i could never see anyway
the early bird gets the worm
the early bird catches the worm
the enemy of my enemy is my friend
the devil you say
the cat's out of the bag
the devil looks after his own
the coast is clear
the fucking you get isn't worth the fucking you take
the company
the ends of the earth

one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind
one who hesitates is lost

one by one
one card shy of a full deck
one age with
one candle short of a box
one brick short of a full load
one or two
once in a while
once more
one should be so lucky
one of those days
one may as well hang for a sheep as a lamb
once or twice

one of those things
one moment, please
one flesh
One Good Turn Deserves Another
one and the same
one saving grace is
one must fight the beast of brutality, to defend one’s stance on neutrality
one can run but one can't hide
one good turn deserves another
one man's meat is another man's poison
one could be someone's parent
once the toothpaste is out of the tube!
one never knows
one eye lookin at a squirrel and the other eye lookin at a possum.
one after another
one for all, all for one
one fell swoop
one and all
one after the other
one man's gain is another man's loss.
one more time for the sweet souvenir
