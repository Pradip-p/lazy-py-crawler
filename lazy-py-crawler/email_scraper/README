### Email Scraper
This Python script uses the Selenium library to scrape email addresses from a list of websites. It navigates to each website, extracts the email addresses from the page source, removes any duplicate email addresses, and saves the data to a CSV file.

#### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Selenium library
Chrome WebDriver
Installation
Install Python 3.x from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### Install the Selenium library by running the following command:

Copy code
`pip install selenium`

Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version. The WebDriver can be downloaded from the official ChromeDriver website: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads. Make sure to place the WebDriver executable in a location accessible by the script.

#### Usage
Open the Python script in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Update the urls list variable with the URLs of the websites you want to scrape.

(Optional) Modify the Chrome options in the start_request function to customize the WebDriver's behavior. For example, you can enable or disable extensions or run the script in headless mode.

Run the script by executing the following command:

`python scraped_email.py`
The script will start scraping the websites one by one. If any email addresses are found on a webpage, they will be saved to a CSV file named export.csv. The CSV file will have two columns: URL and Email. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created, and the column headers will be added.

Once the scraping process is complete, the script will print "scraping started...."

#### Customization
You can modify the find_emails function to change the regular expression used to extract email addresses. Make sure to understand the implications of modifying the regular expression and test it thoroughly.

The write_data_to_csv function can be customized to write data to a different file format or storage medium if desired.

#### Notes
This script requires a stable internet connection to access the websites and extract data.

It is essential to respect the website's terms of service and not abuse or overload their servers with excessive requests. Make sure to use this script responsibly and within legal limits.

The script utilizes the Chrome WebDriver. If you prefer a different browser, you can modify the script accordingly and use the appropriate WebDriver for that browser.

Selenium is a powerful library for web scraping and automation, but it may not always be the most efficient or fastest method. Consider using alternative libraries or techniques for specific use cases or large-scale scraping tasks.

This script serves as a basic template for scraping email addresses from websites. Additional error handling, logging, or data validation mechanisms can be added to enhance its functionality and reliability.

Note: The effectiveness and legality of web scraping may vary depending on the website's terms of service, the jurisdiction you operate in, and the nature of the data being scraped. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and comply with applicable laws and regulations.
