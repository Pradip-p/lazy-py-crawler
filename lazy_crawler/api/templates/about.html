        <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Lazy Crawler was built on the belief that data should be
            accessible to everyone, not just those with massive engineering teams. We've taken the complexity out of
            Scrapy and Playwright to give you a tool that just works.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Why Lazy Crawler?</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Most scraping tools are either too simple to handle modern websites or too
            complex for a quick prototype. We found the middle ground. By combining Scrapy's scale with Playwright's
            rendering, we've created a framework that empowers you to scrape anything from a single news article to
            millions of e-commerce products.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">The Purple Standard</h2>
        <p>In our world, purple stays for productivity. We've designed our entire ecosystem—from the code to the
            dashboard—to be the most productive part of your data pipeline.</p>
